# Possible Data Science Portfolio Pieces

* Watch someone code, analyze, or explore data on a livestream or YouTube page. Describe what you learned, what surprised you, what inspired you, and what you will try to incorperate into your own data science practice. What they would do differently? What lingering questions do you have for the coder or analyst? You can submit a portfolio item of this nature once.

* Think of a scientific or social question that you really care about that you think could be answered or at least inspected with data. Describe the ideal dataset that would help you answer this question (data collection setup, the cases and variables of interest, and an approximate order of magnitude for the desired sample size). What could go wrong in the data collection and what other related questions could this data be useful for? Does such a dataset actually exist? If not, what obstacles stand in the way of such a dataset existing? You can submit a portfolio item of this nature once.

* Go to the [Dear Data Website](https://www.dear-data.com/theproject) and examine some of the data visualizations these two information designers created. Gather data about yourself for a week and make a visualization in the style of the Dear Data Postcards. You can submit a portfolio item of this nature twice.

* Participate in [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). Join the current week's submission, or create a submission for a past week. For your post, you should write about the process you went through and the decisions you made. It is worth looking through other people's submissions to get a sense of what can be done! Usually, submissions are posted on the [Data Science Learning Community slack](dslc.io/join). You can submit a portfolio item of this nature three times.

* Find an interesting data visualization in the news and recreate it. Describe the challenges in doing so, and what you had to learn. You can submit a portfolio item of this nature twice.

* Collect visualizations that have a common theme that you find effective. Display the visualizations and write about why so find them effective. Reflect on how this inspires your future work as a data scientist. You can submit a portfolio item of this nature once.

* Create a user-friendly interactive visualization. Write about your design decisions and reflect on further improvements you could make. You can submit a portfolio item of this nature once.

* Answer up to two of Daniel Litt's probability puzzles using simulation.

* Finish the [Pokemon Pandas Activity](https://github.com/drspoulsen/csi-220-fa-24/blob/main/lesson_plans/2024-9-9/2024-9-9-Numpy.md) and write about what you learned in the process.

* Finish the [Fat Bear Week Activity](https://github.com/drspoulsen/csi-220-fa-24/blob/main/lesson_plans/10-4-2024.md) and write about what you learned in the process.

* Finish the [Calculus Pre-test Activity]() and write about what you learned in the process.

* We will also have future ethical discussions that merit reflection, and will be assigned as mandatory portfolio pieces.
